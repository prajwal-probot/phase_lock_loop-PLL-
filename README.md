# ON-CHIP clock_multiplier_PLL

Clock multipliers are essential system in processing and computation. 
every complicated circuts like C.P.U and other more clocked based system uses (PLL) technique majorly.
A simple PLL circut is built and following outcomes are simulated in the above git.file

# TOOL USED :
*LT-spice (this is the tool which is used to build PLL circut )

# LT-spice installatioin procedure:
 (ON WINDOWS-7/8 and above..) and (Macintosh Operating System (Mac OS)):
 follow steps :
 1) Go to www.google.com and click on the below link and download LT-spice for (WINDOWS/MAC) based on your operating system.
 https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html
 2) download the complete setup and install it completly.
 3) after installation run the setup-file.
 4) LT-spice software will run.
# LT-spice installation on LINUX-SYSTEM:
 1)LTspice does not run directly on LINUX distributions. 
	
 2)Wine is a linux software that allows you to run various windows programs.
	
 3)Click here to install WINE.https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key
	
 4) Download LTspice setup for windows from LTSpice Download for Windows.Click on Download for windows .
	
 5)Right click on the downloaded setup file and select the option Open With > Wine Windows Program Loader.
 
# RUNNING MY GIT.FILE AND SIMULATING:
1) download my git.file above in zipped format and extract it to a specific drive where LT-spice is downloaded.

2)Now launch the LT-spice software and run it.

3)after opening go to option :
                         1.FILE.
                         2.OPEN.
                         3.Go to drive where downloaded the git.file.
                         4.open the file name :[clock_multiplier_PLL(1).asc].
4)You will automatically get nto my schamatic file and see the circut.

5)YOU can click on 'simulation' option and see the wave-forms.
