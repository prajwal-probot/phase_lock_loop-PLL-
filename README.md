# ON-CHIP clock_multiplier_PLL

Clock multipliers are essential system in processing and computation. 
every complicated circuts like C.P.U and other more clocked based system uses (PLL) technique majorly.
A simple PLL circut is built and following outcomes are simulated in the above git.file

# TOOL USED :
*LT-spice (this is the tool which is used to build PLL circut )
