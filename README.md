# ON-CHIP clock_multiplier_PLL

Clock multipliers are essential system in processing and computation. 
every complicated circuts like C.P.U and other more clocked based system uses (PLL) technique majorly.
A simple PLL circut is built and following outcomes are simulated in the above git.file

# TOOL USED :
*LT-spice (this is the tool which is used to build PLL circut )

# LT-spice installatioin procedure:
 (ON WINDOWS-7/8 and above..) and (Macintosh Operating System (Mac OS)):
 follow steps :
 1) Go to www.google.com and click on the below link and download LT-spice for (WINDOWS/MAC) based on your operating system.

 2) download the complete setup and install it completly.
 3) after installation
